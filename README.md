# documentation-project-list
A simple list of online language documentation projects (by other people), for my own reference. Do with it what you will.

## Currently online

### Moro Documentation Project

<http://moro.ucsd.edu/>

## Archived only

Many documentation projects are fading from the web as websites arenâ€™t maintained or institutions fail to maintain earlier versions. That sucks.

### Wichita
